  # The above options *do not* affect actual enchantment rarities. They are purely for cosmetic purposes, like in item lores.

advanced:
  force-dropqueue: true
  # When combined with collate, this massively reduces calls to getItemMeta, which can hurt performance when many enchants are on an item.
  # Enabling this option makes all drops go through telekinesis listeners
  lore-getter:
    # This converts enchantments with matching names from other enchantment plugins from lore into real enchantments.
    # This is experimental not recommended to be used for extended periods of time: enchantments are automatically converted.
    # Only use this if absolutely necessary as it may cause some bugs.
    enabled: false
    aggressive: false
    # Aggressive mode converts all items in all inventories when opened.
    # This will most likely have a significant performance penalty.
  hide-fixer:
    # Fixes some items obtained in older versions with a bug that caused enchantments to be hidden.
    # Works both in packets to display the enchants to the client as well as changing the server-side item too.
    # Only use this option if you've encountered this bug as it may strip HideEnchants from items that you might not expect it to.
    enabled: false
    aggressive: false
    # Aggressive mode converts all items in all inventories whenever revealed.
    # This may impact performance.
    force: false # If **all** items should have hide enchants removed - absolute last ditch effort, most likely to break other things.
  hard-disable:
    # Fixes potential problems with other plugins where the enchantments are still present when disabled.
    # Enabling this prevents the enchantments from being registered with the server at all when disabled.
    # There may be some unknown problems with this, but will fix bugs with plugins such as Slimefun.
    # Hard disabled enchantments will not update on /ecoreload. You will have to restart your server.
    enabled: false
  dual-registration:
    # Fixes potential plugin conflicts/serialization issues when updating from a version before 7.3.0.
    # Registers byName both the internal enchantment name (new method) and the display name (old method).
    # There may be potential bugs with having duplicate enchantments, so enable this only if you need it.
    enabled: true
  level-clamp:
    # Helps reverse players who have illegal above-max-level enchantments.
    # When holding an item, any enchantments above their max level will be set to the max level in order to prevent illegal items.
    # Players with ecoenchants.bypasslevelclamp permission will be ignored.
    # This may impact performance.
