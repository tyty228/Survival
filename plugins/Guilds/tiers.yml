# This section of the config will talk about various parts of upgrading a guild and allow you to choose how it works.
# For "mob-xp-multiplier" the default is 1, meaning that it will drop the normal amount of XP for non-upgraded guilds.
# DO NOT set it to 0, that will either throw errors or cause mobs to not drop XP.
# Keep in mind for the damage-multiplier, it applies to players also, so by default it's set to normal for every tier.
